# Low Level Design Patterns in Golang

In this repository, we will design some common systems which might help you in your Low-Level Design (LLD) or Machine Coding rounds of your interview. Everything will be implemented in **Golang**. If you want to gain experience with Go, these designs will help you significantly in getting a grasp of the language.

## Design Framework

For Low-Level Designs, I have created a framework that you can use for any design you want to make. Please keep in mind that this template is based on my approach. Your design might differ, potentially including more features, but everything will follow this general template. As we all know that **No Design is a Perfect Design**.

### Requirements

1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - What should the system do?

2. **Non-Functional Requirements**:
   - Considerations for speed, scale, and reliability.

3. **Constraints**:
   - Any limitations or restrictions.

### Core Components

Identify the key parts of the system.

### Data Storage & Models

- How will data be stored? (Database, data structures)
- Define essential entities and their relationships.

### Main Operations

- Core actions and their algorithms.

### Scalability

- How will the system handle growth? (e.g., more users, more data)

### Error Handling

- Common and edge cases to consider.
